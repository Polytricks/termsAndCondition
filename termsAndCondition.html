        <p>
            By using the Politricks App, you agree to its Terms and Conditions,
            which ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability in evaluating politicians.
            The app enables citizens to assess politicians based on ten key criteria: age, education,
            political experience, ethnic and religious harmony, populist projects, economic policies,
            international relations, foreign direct investment initiatives, political character,
            and personal character. Each politician is given a public score based on these factors,
            preventing misinformation and allowing voters to make informed decisions. The age criterion
            ensures a balance of youthfulness and experience, with optimal scores assigned to politicians
            aged 45–50 (10 points) while younger than 25 or older than 75 receive 0 points. The education
            criterion reflects intellectual capacity, with a PhD earning 10 points, a Master’s degree 8 points,
            and an Ordinary Level qualification only 1 point. Political experience is a crucial factor, awarding 10
            points for a President, 8 for a Prime Minister or Cabinet Minister, and varying scores for Provincial or
            District Councilors based on public input. These three criteria are mandatory and must be verifiable to
            prevent fraudulent claims.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app also assesses politicians based on their attitudes toward ethnic and religious harmony
            (self-evaluated and verified by public input, 0–10 points) to discourage divisiveness. Their ability to
            launch meaningful populist projects annually (0–10 points) is evaluated to ensure public funds are used
            effectively, discouraging unrealistic or wasteful initiatives. Their economic policies (0–10 points)
            are assessed based on their stance on economic growth, taxation, and sustainability, ensuring they
            contribute
            to national development. The app also evaluates their stance on international relations and
            geopolitics (0–10 points), considering their positions on key alliances with countries like the USA, China,
            and India to assess long-term diplomatic strategies. The ability to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
            (0–10 points) is also crucial, as politicians must demonstrate how they plan to utilize Sri Lanka’s unique
            resources,
            such as marine and natural assets, to drive economic progress.
        </p>
        <p>
            The political character of a politician (0–10 points) is determined by public perception, leadership
            consistency, and reputation within the community, while the personal character score (0–10 points)
            evaluates factors such as marital status, personal values, and adherence to democratic principles. Public
            input
            plays a significant role in maintaining honesty, and any attempts to falsify or manipulate scores will
            result
            in account suspension. Politicians who score above 7.5 are considered exemplary leaders, while lower scores
            indicate areas for improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Politricks App is designed to reshape the political landscape by promoting informed decision-making,

            system,
            and by signing up, they agree to provide truthful, unbiased assessments that contribute to a more
            transparent
            and accountable political system.
